# AI Instruction

This file contains core AI guidance that applies across all AI-assisted development in this repository. Both `CLAUDE.md` and `.specify/memory/constitution.md` reference this file.

## Project Overview

Scribel is a desktop application for rapid note capture and AI-powered knowledge management, combining quick-jot workflows with agentic AI capabilities. Built as a Tauri + React application, it operates on local markdown files (Obsidian-compatible) with SQLite for jot storage and vector search.

**Core Philosophy:** "Jot first, organize later" — capture thoughts instantly, let AI help connect and structure them over time.

## Critical Performance Targets

These are non-negotiable thresholds that define the user experience:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Cold start to first jot | <500ms |
| Jot creation latency | <50ms |
| Global hotkey response | <200ms |
| Semantic search query | <500ms |
| AI suggestions after jot | <1 second |

## Core Principles

### 1. Performance-First Architecture

Every feature MUST meet strict performance targets before being considered complete.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Use SQLite WAL mode for concurrent access without blocking
- Async Tauri commands to prevent UI blocking
- Debounced search operations (500ms)
- Lazy loading and virtualized scrolling for large datasets
- Content hash checking to avoid unnecessary re-embedding

### 2. Local-First & Privacy by Design

User data MUST remain under user control with privacy as the default:

- All markdown files remain local (never uploaded)
- Only text content sent to AI services (for embeddings and queries)
- API keys stored in system keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service)
- No telemetry or analytics without explicit user opt-in
- Support for local embedding models (Ollama) as alternative to API providers

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Use Tauri's fs API (sandboxed file access) instead of Node fs
- Never log or transmit vault file paths or complete file contents
- Make cloud features opt-in with clear disclosure

### 3. Obsidian Compatibility

Scribel MUST be a compatible layer on top of existing Obsidian vaults:

- Standard markdown with YAML frontmatter support
- `[[wiki-links]]` for internal linking (including `[[filename|display text]]` syntax)
- `#tags` in content
- Daily note format: `YYYY-MM-DD.md` in configurable folder
- Respect `.gitignore` and custom ignore patterns
- Never break Obsidian vault integrity

### 4. Crash Safety & Data Integrity (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

No data loss under any circumstances:

- SQLite with WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode mandatory
- Auto-save on every jot creation
- Undo stack for all AI write operations
- Atomic file operations (write to temp, then rename)
- All database operations use transactions
- Prepared statements for SQL queries (prevent injection)

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React 18+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend | Rust (Tauri 2.x), SQLite with sqlite-vec |
| AI | Anthropic Claude API |
| Embeddings | OpenAI API or Voyage AI (configurable) |
| Primary Platform | macOS 12+ |

### Dependency Constraints

- Prefer lightweight Rust crates to minimize binary size
- Avoid Node.js dependencies in Tauri backend (use Rust alternatives)
- Bundle size target: <50MB for macOS app bundle

## Data Schemas

### Jot Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE jots (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
  tags TEXT,  -- JSON array
  links TEXT, -- JSON array of [[wiki-links]]
  promoted BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0
);
```

### Embeddings Schema
```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE embeddings USING vec0(
  file_path TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  embedding FLOAT[1536],  -- or 1024 for Voyage
  content_hash TEXT,
  updated_at INTEGER
);
```

## Testing Strategy

Features MUST be testable at three levels:

**Unit Tests:**
- Rust: Database operations, file parsing, embedding generation
- TypeScript: React components, hooks, utilities

**Integration Tests:**
- Tauri command invocation from frontend
- File watcher → embedding pipeline
- RAG retrieval accuracy (precision/recall)

**E2E Tests:**
- Jot creation → storage → retrieval
- Vault indexing → semantic search
- AI chat with tool use (mocked)

## AI Development Guidelines

When implementing with AI assistance:

1. **Never block the UI thread** — use async Tauri commands
2. **SQLite queries must use prepared statements** — avoid SQL injection
3. **File operations use Tauri's fs API** — not Node fs
4. **Respect user's vault structure** — never modify files without confirmation
5. **Token budget for Claude API** — aim for <100k tokens per request
6. **Test global hotkey on macOS first** — primary platform
7. **NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or working logs** — only create when explicitly requested
8. **Working logs only during squad work** — WORKING_LOG.md, HANDOFF_NOTES.md should only be created by agents during actual squad implementation, not during setup/consolidation tasks

## AI Development Teams

Scribel is developed by **five AI agent teams** working in parallel via git worktrees.

**For complete parallel development workflow, see [`PARALLEL_WORKFLOW.md`](PARALLEL_WORKFLOW.md).**

### Team Structure

| Team | Role | Worktree | Implements Code? |
|------|------|----------|------------------|
| **FE_DUDES** | Frontend Development | `worktrees/frontend/` | Yes |
| **BE_GEEKS** | Backend Development | `worktrees/backend/` | Yes |
| **AI_GODS** | AI/ML Development | `worktrees/ai/` | Yes |
| **THE_PO** | Product Owner | main repo | No — decisions only |
| **MASTER_TL** | Tech Lead | main repo | No — reviews only |

### Essential Workflow Rules

**Setup**: Run `/squad.new` or `./work/scripts/setup-parallel-dev.sh`

**Communication**:
1. **Handoff Documents**: `work/handoffs/epic-X-fY-FROM-to-TO.md`
2. **Code Comments**: `// AI-DEV-NOTE: @TEAM - message -- by @YOUR_TEAM`

**File Ownership**: Each team owns specific folders
- FE_DUDES: `src/**/*`
- BE_GEEKS: `src-tauri/**/*` (except `ai/`)
- AI_GODS: `src-tauri/src/ai/**/*`

**Merge Policy**: Dev teams NEVER merge directly; create handoffs to THE_PO when ready

**On Startup**: Check `work/handoffs/` and search for `AI-DEV-NOTE: @YOUR_TEAM`

### Feature Naming Convention

- Format: `epic-N/feature-M-short-name`
- Example: `epic-1/feature-1-project-scaffold`

- Folder structure: `plan/epic-N-name/`

### Speckit Workflow

Each feature should have:
