# Epic 6: Advanced Features (Future)

**Goal:** Extensibility and multi-vault support

This Epic contains advanced features planned for future releases, focusing on extensibility and power-user needs.

## Features

|---|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 6.1 | MCP Integration | F9 | Pending | Model Context Protocol support |
| 6.2 | Multiple Vaults | F10 | Pending | Switch between multiple vaults |

## MCP Integration (F9)

**Description:** Support Model Context Protocol for extensibility

- Expose vault as MCP server (for other tools to access)
- Connect to external MCP servers (calendar, task managers, etc.)
- Plugin architecture for custom tools

## Multiple Vaults (F10)

**Description:** Support switching between multiple vaults

## Future Considerations

- **F11: Mobile Companion** — iOS/Android capture-only app (separate project)
- **Cloud Sync** — Optional sync between devices
- **Collaboration** — Shared vaults (requires server)

## Dependencies

- Epic 1-5 (all prior epics for stable foundation)

## Notes
